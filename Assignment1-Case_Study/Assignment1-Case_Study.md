# Assignment 1 - Case Study
# Social Finance (SoFi)

## Overview and Origin

Social Finance, aka. SoFi, was founded in August 2011 by four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

The four founders are Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady. They intended to start an affordable student loan program for students who face financial challenges. Their pilot project was a $2 million loan program funded by alumnis. Their pilot program provided cheap student loans to 100 students.

Today, SoFi has expanded its services into personal loans, mortgages, payments, investments, and insurances.
