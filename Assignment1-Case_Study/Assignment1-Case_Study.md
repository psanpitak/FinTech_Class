## Overview and Origin

Social Finance, aka. SoFi, was founded in August 2011 by four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

The four founders are Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady. They intended to start an affordable student loan program for students who face financial challenge. Their pilot project was a $2 million loan program funded by 40 alumni who invested $20,000 per person on average and loaned to 100 students.
