# lstm_stock_predictor_closing:
In this file, we use closing price in LSTM model to make predictions.
The loss is 0.0444

# lstm_stock_predictor_fng:
In this file, we use fng value in LSTM model to make predictions.
The loss is 0.1048

When compare these two predictions, we found that using closing price is more accurate than using fng.
